# More About Me
### I've worked for great employers throughout the years. Along the way, I've had the opportunity to work on many different kinds of projects requiring data analysis, report design and application development.

### As a freelancer and life-long learner, I continue to learn and enjoy implementing new technologies to help solve existing needs. My strengths are in strategy and the streamlining of business processes. I believe in doing more for less, while using what you have to get by when you need to. As you can afford more, then scale higher. I beliee that cost-effective solutions provide a more lasting benefit. 

### I'll be filling my Github repos with more content as time goes on. Check in from time to time to see if there's anything of interest to you.
