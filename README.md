# More About Me
## I've worked for notable employers throughout the years. I've had the opportunity to work on many different kinds of projects requiring data analysis, report development and computer programming. As a life-long learner, I continue to enjoy learning newer technologies to help solve an existing need. My strengths are in strategy and streamlining of business processes. I believe in doing more for less, and using what you have to get by when you need to. As you can afford more, scale higher. Cost-effective solutions provide lasting benefit. 

## I'll be filling my Github repos with more content as time goes on. Check in from time to time to see if there's anything of interest to you.
