### Hello! <a href="https://github.com/curtild">I'm Lynn Curtis</a>, and I've worked for great employers over the years! In my career, I've had some awesome opportunities to work many successful projects requiring data analysis, data wrangling, metrics, report development, application development and user training. For the few projects that weren't a success... well, let's just say I learned a lot!


### As a professional developer and life-long learner, I continue to implement effective technologies to meet client needs. My strengths are analysis, strategy, and business process streamlining. I believe an organization should be resourceful enough to do more with less, using what they can to get by, when or wherever needed. I've helped organizations maintain their budget while migrating to better platforms to solve their business challenges. I've certainly helped them level up! Organizations typically find cost-effective solutions are of lasting benefit. Here in my Github workspace I'll share what I've learned.


## <em>What's Housed Here?</em>
### You'll soon find many different projects here. At present, I am transferring my projects to Github. I'll be filling my Github repos with more content as time goes by. Check in from time to time to see if there's anything of interest to you.
