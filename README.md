### <em>About Me</em>
<img src="/assets/images/Analysis.png" width="500" height="250"/>

#### Hello! <a href="https://github.com/curtild">I'm Lynn Curtis</a>. 
I have worked for great employers over the years! In my career, I've had some awesome opportunities to work on many successful projects requiring data analysis, data wrangling, metrics, database migrations, report development, application development and user training. For the few projects that weren't a success... well, let's just say I learned a lot!

As a professional developer and life-long learner, I continue to implement effective technologies to meet client needs. My strengths are analysis, strategy, and business process streamlining. I believe an organization should be resourceful enough to do more with less, using what they can to get by, when and wherever needed. I've helped organizations maintain their budget while migrating to better platforms to solve their business needs. I've certainly helped them remain steady and at times, level up! Organizations I've worked for typically found cost-effective solutions were of lasting value. Here in my Github workspace I'll share what I've learned throughout the years.

### <em>What's Housed Here?</em>
You'll soon find many different projects here. At present, I am transferring my projects to Github. I'll be filling my Github repos with more content as time goes by. I'll also be out here working in collaboration on current projects. Check in from time to time to see if there's anything of interest to you.
