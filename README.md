<img src="/assets/images/Analysis.png" width="500" height="250"/>

### Hello! <a href="https://github.com/curtild">I'm Lynn Curtis.</a> I've had the great pleasure to work for great employers over the years! In my career, I've had awesome opportunities to work many successful projects requiring data analysis, data wrangling, report development, application development and user training.


### As both freelancer and life-long learner, I continue to implement effective technologies to meet clients' needs. My strengths are analysis, strategy, and business process streamlining. I believe an organization should be resourceful enough to do more with less, using what they can to get by, whenever needed. As they can afford better solutions to solve business challenges â€” they should level up! Organizations typically find cost-effective solutions are of lasting benefit. 


## <em>What's Housed Here?</em>
### You'll soon find many different projects here. At present, I am transferring my projects to Github. I'll be filling my Github repos with more content as time goes by. Check in from time to time to see if there's anything of interest to you.
